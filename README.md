# PasswordSafe

A personal project.

This is an app I made that stores data to an xml file on your phone or your Google Drive.
It's an easy to use offline app where you can store your passwords or other types of data with a nice and simple interface.
The colors of the user interface are customizable.

## Features:
-Organizing data in a clean folder structure with customizable data blocks.   
-Customizable UI colors.   
-Saving your data locally.   
-Saving your data to Google Drive.   
-Restoring your saved data on Google Drive to your phone.   

## Known Issues:   
-Saving to Google Drive for the very first time may sometimes require the user to restart the app.
